Hey, Laura and Dominik here!

We've studied and worked together on several R projects in many domains over the last few years. There were shiny apps, machine learning, bioinformatics, Rcpp, data visualization... we can't even list it all. And the time has come to share that knowledge.

We want to have a few types of blog posts: some talking about our experiences with certain packages/frameworks (looking at you, shiny!), some sharing obscure knowledge and R facts, some showing how to implement something in a given framework, and some giving an overview of existing solutions to certain problems. And maybe an occasional rambling about other languages (especially C++ due to the existence of Rcpp) as well.

If you have an idea for a post (especially How To and Overview post types), tag us [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rturtletopia) or make an issue [on Github](https://github.com/turtletopia/turtletopia.github.io/issues).

This blog uses a [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) framework.
